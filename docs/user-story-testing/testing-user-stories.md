    **b.** You can see that there is an About page in the nav bar that explains Crystal Clear Optician's values. There's also a map with the location and a contact form. 
    The embedded map from Google Maps, has an indistinct location that doesn't relate to Crystal Clear Opticians. Unfortunately, it's no possible to supply a real map here as Crystal Clear Opticians and its town is a fictional place. Adding placeholder content is is my only option.
