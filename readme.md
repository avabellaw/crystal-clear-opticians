Slow load speed is bad for UX. 
The initial load time before caching the JavaScript is **8.5+ seconds**!

### GIFS

GIF animation to demonstrate FIELDS test created by me using paint.net and [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/maker). I used 12 pictures.
I made the contrast quite low which was realistic however decided to edit the gif using ezgif maker to improve visibility. I decreased the brightness (-15%) and increased the contrast (+50%).
